For our final project presented at our Girls Who Code Intuit branch (2016), myself and two friends worked together to create a website that would, in theory, connect schools to their local dog shelters to sponsor stress-reliving activities for students during exam seasons and promote animal adoption/rescue. The project took around 2 weeks to plan and build from the ground up. We mainly utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring this vision to life, and we attempted to use Firebase API in order to implement an account system where users would be able to track their own appointments and favorite shelters' activities.
